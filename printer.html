<p style="font-size: larger;">
        One common real-life example of process synchronization is a printer. Imagine a scenario where multiple users are connected to a shared printer, and each user sends a print job to the printer at the same time.

<p style="font-size: larger;">In this case, the printer acts as a shared resource, and each print job is considered a separate process. Without proper process synchronization, the printer may become overwhelmed with multiple print jobs arriving at the same time and fail to print them correctly.</p>

<p style="font-size: larger;">To prevent this from happening, the operating system uses process synchronization techniques to ensure that only one print job is processed at a time. This is typically accomplished through the use of a synchronization primitive, such as a semaphore or a mutex, which allows only one process to access the shared resource at a time.</p>

<p style="font-size: larger;">In this way, process synchronization ensures that each print job is printed correctly and that the printer is not overloaded with too many requests at the same time.</p>
